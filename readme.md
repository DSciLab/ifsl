# Interventional Few-Shot Learning

This project provides a strong Baseline with WRN28-10 and ResNet-10 backbone for the following Few-Shot Learning methods:

- Fine-tuning
- Matching Networks
- Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
- Meta-Transfer Learning for Few-Shot Learning (MTL)
- Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO)
- Synthetic Information Bottleneck (SIB)

This also includes implementation of our **NeurIPS 2020** paper  [Interventional Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13000), which proposes IFSL classifier based on intervention P(Y|do(X)) to remove the confounding bias from pre-trained knowledge. Our IFSL classifier is generally applicable to all fine-tuning and meta-learning method, easy to plug in and involves no additional training steps.

The codes are organized into four folders according to methods. The folder *MAML_MN_FT* contains baseline and IFSL for fine-tuning, Matching Networks and MAML.

## Dependencies

Recommended version:
- Python 3.7.6
- PyTorch 1.4.0

## Preparation

- Download pre-trained backbone in https://github.com/mileyan/simple_shot
- Download mini-ImageNet following https://github.com/hushell/sib_meta_learn
- Tiered-ImageNet download instruction https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/meta-transfer-learning
- Download CUB from official website http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html

After downloading the weights and datasets, you can follow the instructions in each folder to modify the code and finish preparation.

## TODO

Apologize in advance for dirty code, which I will clean up gradually.

- Code refactoring
- Improve documentation and optimize project setup procedures
